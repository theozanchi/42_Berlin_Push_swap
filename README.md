# Push_swap
Because Swap_push isnâ€™t as natural

**This project is Work in Progress and will be updated**

# To-do list
* All the helper functions have been written (*sa*, *sb*, *pa*, *pb*, *ra*, *rb*, *rr*, *rra*, *rrb* and *rrr*)
* NB: the helper functions currently only modify the value of the elements of the stack, not their index. 
* **TO-DO**: check wether the index should remain constant or be updated at each step
